# What is Core Banking?

Core banking is the central backend system that handles transactions, operations, and client management for financial institutions, including banks, digital banks, e-money institutions, and payment service providers, in real-time. It centralises various banking services and processes, providing a cohesive and integrated customer experience. Essentially, core banking is the backbone that enables banks and fintech companies to deliver seamless, efficient, and dependable services to their customers.

## Key Components of Core Banking

### Customer Onboarding

The Customer Onboarding module manages the registration and management of new clients and the setup of their accounts. It facilitates collecting and verifying customer information, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML). Through automated workflows and seamless integration with external verification services, onboarding reduces manual effort, minimises errors, and accelerates account activation. Additionally, a smooth onboarding experience enhances customer satisfaction and sets the stage for a positive ongoing relationship with the financial institution.

### AML/KYC

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) are critical components of the onboarding process and transaction management, ensuring financial institutions comply with regulatory standards to prevent fraud and money laundering. These processes involve verifying customer identities, monitoring transactions, and assessing risks. Core banking systems can integrate AML/KYC services through APIs provided by compliance service providers such as Sumsub, iSpiral, Veriff, and others. This integration enables digital banks to streamline customer onboarding, enhance due diligence, and maintain up-to-date compliance without requiring extensive in-house resources. By leveraging these third-party services, financial entities can efficiently meet regulatory requirements and safeguard their operations.

### Account management

Account management handles the creation, maintenance, and closure of customer accounts. It supports various account types, including current, savings, loans, and investments, ensuring accurate and real-time updates to account balances and transaction histories. This module also enables personalised services by maintaining detailed customer profiles and preferences. With robust security measures and compliance with regulatory standards, account management ensures the integrity and confidentiality of customer data.

### Transaction processing

Transaction processing involves managing various transactions, including card and mobile payments, internal transfers, SEPA, SWIFT, CHAPS, BACS, FPS, and other local payment types, as well as withdrawals and utility bill payments. This functionality is enabled by connecting the core banking system to different payment-as-a-service or embedded finance providers, developing its own payment infrastructure, and obtaining the required registrations and memberships (e.g., SEPA, SWIFT). This ensures real-time processing, security, and compliance with regulations.

### Currency exchange

Currency exchange allows customers to buy, sell, and convert currencies competitively. The core banking system should be integrated with FX and liquidity providers (e.g., Currency Cloud) to access real-time exchange rates and ensure efficient transaction execution. These integrations enhance the financial institution’s ability to manage currency risk, provide better pricing, and improve overall service quality.

### Card issuing

The card issuing module manages the entire lifecycle of a card, from issuance and activation to expiration and renewal, ensuring seamless and secure card operations. To offer this service, a financial services entity must acquire a Principal membership from a specific card scheme (e.g., Mastercard, Visa), granting the authority to issue cards directly. Alternatively, they can act as an agent for an official card issuer or an IBAN sponsor (e.g., Decta, Wallester). In this arrangement, the core banking system integrates with the card issuer to provide card issuance.

### Reporting

Reporting provides comprehensive insights into financial activities and operational performance. This module generates detailed reports on transactions, account balances, and other key metrics, aiding decision-making and strategic planning. It also ensures regulatory compliance by producing accurate and timely financial statements and regulatory filings. Additionally, reporting capabilities help identify trends, detect anomalies, and support audits, enhancing the overall transparency and accountability of the bank’s or fintech company’s operations.
